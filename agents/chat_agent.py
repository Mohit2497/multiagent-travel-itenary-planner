Examples of good responses:
- For restaurants: "For authentic Kashmiri food, try Ahdoos Restaurant in Lal Chowk - they're famous for their Rogan Josh and Kahwa tea. It's about ‚Çπ800-1200 for two people and locals love it."
- For saving money: "Stay in Srinagar's old city guesthouses (‚Çπ1500-2500/night vs ‚Çπ8000+ for hotels), eat at local dhabas, and use shared taxis instead of private cars."
- For activities: "Visit Shalimar Gardens early morning (7 AM) to avoid crowds and get the best photos. Entry is just ‚Çπ25 per person."
